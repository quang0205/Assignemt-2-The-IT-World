                                <li><b><u> Team Name: </u></b></li>
                                <p>The group name I chose for my future group is "<strong>The Fat Guy </strong> ".</p>
                                <p>The reason I chose this name because it has a very special meaning. 
                                    The word "<strong> Fat </strong>" is not about the body, it is used to talk about ideas. A group with so many, so many ideas becomes 'Fat-ideas'. 
                                    The word "<strong> Guy </strong>" is a word used to refer to friends with a friendly attitude and a sense of familiarity, especially with a group with enough friendliness and familiarity, it will be easier to cooperate. 
                                    Because friendly enough will bring intimacy, and they are always a prerequisite for a sustainable partnership. 
                                    Sum up, "<strong>The Fat Guy </strong>" means "<i> familiar friends with endless ideas </i>"</p>
                                <li><b><u> Team Profile: </u></b></li>
                                <img src="./Picture/personality test.JPG" alt="">
                                <p>As a result of the personality test, I'm a right-brainer who is susceptible to emotions. This affects me a lot at work, I find it hard to stay calm during conflicts, leading to conflicts that become difficult to resolve, and tension escalating. 
                                    At the same time, with this vulnerability, my work progress becomes longer than I expected, instead of just a few hours to complete the job, it sometimes takes me a day to complete, because it takes time to adjust to emotions. However, acting on emotions led to me becoming friendlier and easier to get along with people. 
                                    Besides, as a way to reconcile the conflict, I became more suitable to cooperate and avoid conflict as much as possible, it made it difficult for my job to go a big step because there was no conflict, but it makes my work more stable and harmonious. 
                                    Based on this, I hope my future team will consist of 5 people including 2 people who can create and make conflicts (who prefer competition to cooperation), 3 people become mediators (friendly people, promote cooperation over conflict). 
                                    Create conflicts for the team to develop and help the project make big breakthroughs because conflict is always the result of competition (competition is the premise of all developments). 
                                    Merging to create a connection between members to avoid conflicts out of control, prevent teams from disagreeing that become disbanded or uncooperative, and they must also become a premise for the trust among team members. 
                                    5 people to be sure that in the case of a conflict between members that cannot be reconciled by normal means can be drawn to solve the problem (there is always one side to win) or simply the minority must follow the majority.
                                    </p>
