                                <p><b> Summary and discussion: </b> Masa is a game programmer for Bandai Konami (one of Japan's biggest game companies). His job is to write code for the Game (who is in charge of the operation of the Game). 
                                    He interacts mostly with fellow IT professionals (Game developers, Game designers) or a few people in the financial department. 
                                    Due to the nature of his work, he spends a lot of time at his desk with the computer. 
                                    The biggest challenge with this job is the understanding of the game and programming ability. Programmers build games using code so this requires solid programming knowledge and proficiency in the programming language. 
                                    Besides, there must be a good understanding of the game, because you have to build the game according to the idea of ​​the game developer, so if you are not knowledgeable about the game you will not understand the idea of ​​the game developer.

                                <p><b> Summary and discussion: </b>A normal Cybersecurity Specialist day is like everyone else. He wakes up, does personal chores like brushing his teeth, washing his face, and having breakfast. He works 9 hours a day. In this case, he attended a meeting before starting official work, most of his time was spent on computers,
                                     he was responsible for ensuring the maintenance of infrastructure, network systems. It can be said that the places where he spends the most time are in his office and his computer. He interacts mostly with other IT professionals while on the job. 
                                     For an industry like Cybersecurity, it takes a huge amount of knowledge about cybersecurity (especially information security and data management capabilities), firewalls, and bug or hacking factors.

                                <p><b> Summary and discussion: </b>Zach is an information systems technician whose job covers all aspects of information technology, but he focuses on doing a lot of computer imaging. Every day to him is always new because his job is never the same every day. 
                                    He interacts a lot with customers. Every day he spends most of his time in front of his computer in his office. The biggest challenge of this job is the difficulty in defining the job purpose exactly. 
                                    Everyday renewal makes it impossible to plan and time properly.

                                <p><b> Summary and discussion: </b>Chris is an IT support technician, and he works at Datacom Systems in Wellington. His job includes answering technical queries given by the company's customers. Most of the objects he interacts with are the company's customers, sometimes also employees from other areas such as sales and management. 
                                    It can also be said that he spends most of his time online and on systems. Most of the time he works at his desk, but sometimes he can work from home. This depends on his schedule. His love for the industry comes from the occasional sense of accomplishment he can help people connect with by fixing links between websites. 
                                    The industry's biggest challenge lies in the fact that you need to have a diverse range of knowledge (a little knowledge of everything) about software development, service support, and network issues.

                                <p><b> Summary and discussion: </b>Nick is a game developer, his job includes writing code to build the structured game (content, how it works). He started working from 9 am until he completes it, outside of work he writes code for his game. 
                                    He works from home, most of the time he stays at home unless he goes out to buy necessities for himself. With the person who works in game development, he often interacts with the client (game players) and other areas where he works (designer, programmer). 
                                    The biggest challenge for game developers is the problem of ideas, it is directly related to creativity and inspiration. Without enough creativity, the Game will not be good, the idea will be bad. Without inspiration, you cannot create, without ideas. 
                                    A successful game designer needs to have the perfect combination of inspiration and creativity.
