								<h2>Feedback</h2>

							<ul>
								<li><b>The first feedback (Tran Hau Duc â€“ 3863937): </b><i>This is a project with a good idea, clear structure, at the same time, it also has a lot of space to exploit and develop. 
																							However, a game without a storyline is very easy for players to not have a clear purpose, easily leading to a lack of motivation and early quit the game. 
																							Although there are many adventurous players, this is a small minority among the players. 
																							So, I think you should reconsider the issue of the plot.</i></li>
																							<p></p>
								<p><b>Respond to feedback:</b></p>

								<p>This was a very helpful response, it pointed out my shortcomings. 
									At first, I thought, I could use the side quest system to stimulate the player's desire to explore to better integrate the player into the world, 
									but I forgot that without the main storyline, playing will be difficult at the beginning and easy to lose direction, leading to a state of not knowing what to do next. 
									At the same time, not having a story will make the game more boring. 
									However, increasing a complete story will make the game lose its original purpose as a non-linear game without a plot, so I'll just increase the story on a basic level that grants players a purpose to go to 4 lands 
									(perhaps each land will have a god's treasure, gathered enough to be able to summon gods, to go to another world). 
									This will give players a destination for them to have a goal, avoid the boredom of not knowing what to do, and will quit the game. 
									I will also increase the ability to complete the quest (maybe 3 to 4 ways according to the player's mindset), helping to avoid the linearity of the game as much as possible. 
									I can also add NPC's storylines, to make the game more authentic, and to be more popular with gamers.</p>
									<p></p>

								<li><b>The second feedback (Nguyen Duc Dai - 3878023): </b><i>From what I've read, you are trying to create a game that is 'nearly perfect non-linear' (as you say). 
																							But I still see in the game a lot of linearities, the most noticeable thing is the problem of magic. 
																							The only two ways a player can possess spells is to increase his sympathy with the NPC and solve mysteries.  Basically, this is linear, since the player can only possess spells in these two ways. 
																							Also, there is something quite unreasonable in your game, 
																							the player can only get a hint of the mystery by communicating with the NPC, so why should the player need to open the mystery to get the spell, when they just need interaction with NPC and they will have it?</i></li>
																							<p></p>
								<p>
									<p><b>Respond to feedback:</b></p>
									
									This is a very positive response to me, because it tells me what I am wrong. 
									Thanks to this feedback I noticed that in the structure of the world I want to create there are still a lot of linear bugs, but there are some bugs that are difficult to change. 
									These bugs are the basic structure of a game, the logic of the game, for example, the player had a spell because they learned it from someone or they opened it from a treasure chest, 
									they will accept it, because it makes sense and they won't have any hesitation. 
									On the contrary, if they get it for no reason, they'll get annoyed about it (a bad experience) and they'll easily quit the game. Because of that, 
									I can only increase the gain by various ways such as on the way to pick up an item or knock the enemy NPC down. 
									It is difficult to find a way to avoid linearity in this problem. 
								</br><p></p>
								As for the second problem, it is not really effective feedback, and I completely disagree with it. First, the player can still solve the mystery without any hint from the NPC, for example, 
								when the player is going to a certain location, on the way they see an area and suspect that it is a mystery.  
								They can come and solve it, although it will take longer than the player has a hint from the NPC, which is the player's choice. 
								Also, the spells in the mystery and the spell NPC possesses aren't always the same, so the player can't just choose one side to get the spell.
