									<li><b> Status and operation of Cybersecurity and Privacy: </b></li>
										<p><i>
											Under the rapid development of the current era, the network industry gradually consolidates its position and grows more and more, with products asserting its position such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc. However, this development also comes with a lot of risks, it is the issue of Privacy and Cybersecurity. 
											It can be seen very clearly that information theft occurs every day, as long as you accidentally click on an unknown link, your information will be immediately stolen. Or just hacker attacks, for example, hackers took advantage of coronavirus to attack users in Japan. 
											A series of emails are sent with logos of medical organizations and authorities trying to participate in disease prevention, users who click on this link will be directed to a fake website, they are used to signing Bank account information theft [1]. 
											Or simply because of the developer's fault for not doing well in security, the Aadhaar data leak affected about 135 million people in India, caused by the company do not care about security [2]. 
											Therefore, it can be seen that cybersecurity and privacy are an urgent issue that needs to be resolved with a lasting solution (No solution can completely solve this problem unless the world has no bad people and everyone is perfect, or all talented people don't do bad things).
										</br><p></p>
											Although this problem is still happening, there are always a few short-term solutions for it, there are many tools and software to assist the user in this problem like SolarWinds Security Event Manager, Intruder, or Wireshark (free). 
											Currently, with these software programs and tools, users can partly avoid the threats of network security. Honestly, these dangers are largely caused by users, because users' awareness of cybersecurity is relatively low, so they are often not careful with ambiguous links, which leads to low security, and they harm themselves.
										</br><p></p>
											Let's put a hypothesis about the future three years later, with the influence and development of information technology, the user's vigilance will be raised. Besides, there exist many tools and software that are powerful enough to keep users away from malicious code before they interact with it. 
											Perhaps it will mitigate the impact of the network security risks somewhat. For companies, there will also be better and more effective solutions to increase the security of users' information and eliminate cybersecurity risks. 
											However, every development always comes with two sides, so hackers' skills and tricks will also be enhanced. So, the cybersecurity war is always an endless one.
										</br><p></p>
											To achieve the development of this 3-year hypothesis requires a lot of factors. First, when it comes to people's consciousness, there are two direct effects on their consciousness, the actual situation, and the influence of the government. 
											There is no higher vigilance than the vigilance of someone who has ever been harmed, their awareness of cybersecurity is very high. As for those who have not been in the real situation, they need the influence of the government such as propaganda, strong deterrence, and strict punishment. 
											This attitude of the government will affect the people. Besides consciousness, the level of technology and technical facilities must also develop in parallel, computers are increasingly strong because of the development of memory, skills, and development level because of competition constantly fighting hackers and cybersecurity specialists (tools and software are constantly updated and developed). 
											Although it only needs to meet all the above factors to achieve a future like the 3-year hypothesis, information technology always has variables and exceptions that we do not know. Let's put another hypothesis, if a hacker or cybersecurity expert takes a big step forward in their system, won't the 3-year future change, the balance will turn to another side. 
											The three-year hypothetical world will go in a different direction.
										</i></p>

									<li><b>The impact of Cybersecurity and Privacy:</b></li>
										<p><i>
											The evolution of cybersecurity and privacy has led to a lot of impacts, of which two are main. The first is human consciousness, many modern software and tools appear, making people dependent on them, reducing their vigilance. If the system warns they will avoid it, but if it doesn't warn (the hacker finds the system's vulnerabilities) they will interact with it. 
											In the past, people would be more careful with unknown links, but with a state-of-the-art cybersecurity solution, people definitely wouldn't care if the link was safe or not. They only care if the notification system is accessible or not. This phenomenon occurs mostly in individuals and does not appear in the company or a group. 
											Another impact that is difficult to judge as good or bad, is that hackers' skills and tricks will be enhanced. 
											It can be assumed that the solutions (tools, software) are walls, then hackers are the ones trying to penetrate those walls. As they continually search for a way through the wall, their skill is increasing, but in parallel with this, the walls are always upgraded and patched, it can be said that this is a proportional evolution between hacker relationship and solution. 
											Of course, the people most affected are the users of the solutions (be it individuals, companies, and even large corporations). 
											Both of these can give cybersecurity professionals more work (additional benefits) as they have to race with hackers to find effective solutions to protect users' information.
										</i></p>

									<li><b>The effect of the Cybersecurity and Privacy development on my life:</b></li>
										<p><i>
											This development does not affect me a lot. As for my future work, it gives me a choice that offers more opportunities to grow, a more open future as a cybersecurity specialist. 
											In terms of everyday life, I don't think this development can make an impact on me and my family members, because it is a parallel development. Cybersecurity has grown, hackers have also followed suit. 
											It can be said that there hasn't been any development that has created an inclination in one direction. 
											Put those two things on the table we can see, from the past to the future, the value of both never change and always equal, if that has changed only in a period and then will return to the position balance.

								<li><b><u>Artificial intelligence and machine learning: </u></b></li>
								<ul style="list-style: decimal;">
									<li><b>Status and operation of Artificial intelligence and machine learning:</b></li>
										<p><i> 
											One of the fields that opened the door of a new era for humans is artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
											AI now has a lot of strides like Siri (a smart personal assistant that is part of Apple's iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, and a byproduct of operating systems from an original project developed by the SRI International Center for Artificial Intelligence) or 
											Alexa (a virtual assistant developed by Amazon, capable of voice interactions and working as a control system automatic home by controlling other smart devices). 
										</br><p></p>

											From the above examples, it can be seen the massive development of artificial intelligence. Along with this development is the development of machine learning, which makes artificial intelligence increasingly intelligent than in the past. 
											For example, in 2015, AlphaGo defeated European Go champion Fan Hui - professional 2 dan with a score of 5 without handicap. In 2016, AlphaGo played five games against the Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol (ranked 9th, one of the best players in Go), out of five games AlphaGo won four games and Lee only won game four. 
											From here we can see the progress of artificial intelligence (under the effect of machine learning). 
										</br><p></p>

											From the current development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we can see that in the next three years, they will have remarkable developments. 
											Typically, artificial intelligence can communicate with people naturally, expressing their own emotions. 
											However, this development also comes with many risks such as artificial intelligence having its own thoughts, and whether they have intrigue? As in fantasy movies, artificial intelligence takes over the world and destroys all of humanity. 
											This is always a difficult problem to find the right answer for all of humanity. 
										</br><p></p>

											Let's put a hypothesis that, humans can fully control artificial intelligence, it is completely a wonderful future, where we just need to ask and artificial intelligence will fulfill all of our needs. 
										</br><p></p>

											To achieve this improvement we need a revolutionary breakthrough in machine learning. 
											Typically, a certain measure can convert emotions and expressions into data that artificial intelligence can understand and implement. 
											More simply, it's a breakthrough in language, so that computers can understand the language we speak 100%, and respond naturally (currently artificial intelligence can only understand about 70 % to 80% of our language - Siri is an example, she doesn't understand 100% of what we say to her). 
											Also, we need a breakthrough in storage technology, we need a system big enough to transmit data and store data for artificial intelligence. At the same time, we also need to add a breakthrough in raw materials to create artificial intelligence, this material must be durable and have good water and heat resistance. 
											Maybe in the future, we can use artificial intelligence to make rescue missions (fire, rescue people in dangerous environments) simpler and faster. 
										</br><p></p>
										</i></p>

									<li><b>The impact of Artificial intelligence and machine learning:</b></li>
										<p><i> 
											The development of artificial intelligence has a lot of impact on the functioning of the world, of which 'work' is the most affected. AI systems are ready to "occupy" thousands, or even millions of human jobs in many fields. Cashiers, receptionists, telemarketers, and bank tellers are all likely to be fired and replaced with AI. 
											With self-driving cars, fully autonomous drones, truck drivers, postal workers, courier services, and even pizza delivery workers will be unemployed. Factories are also becoming fully automated. Car wash service, movie theater, or convenience store with no employees started appearing. Even the work that requires brain manipulation as a journalist is also threatened by algorithms that collect information, write self-synthesis articles accurately and quickly. 
											However, it will also open up new job opportunities. Write software, repair, and maintain robots, or develop better new systems. More notably, machines can also be used to undertake hazardous work. Fire fighting, mining, deep-sea oil drilling, construction, and other occupations with high mortality will be replaced by machines. However, AI will become worse when it is oriented "derailed". As long as a few tech monopolies control the latest breakthroughs in data collection, processing, and analysis, it can be detrimental to society. 
											Facebook's Artificial Intelligence story created its language in 2017 is a testament. Instead of using English, they developed a new code system on their own to communicate more effectively. This makes the engineers and researchers here have to manually destroy this artificial intelligence [2]. It can be said that artificial intelligence that creates bad or good effects has a huge part of the responsibility of the AI creator. 
											Therefore, people need to be extremely cautious about AI, unable to know what happens when artificial intelligence encounters "technical errors", or "voluntary action".
										</i></p>

									<li><b>The effect of Artificial intelligence and machine learning on my life:</b></li>
										<p><i> 
											The development of artificial intelligence has influenced the lives of me and my friends' families. Their intelligence makes me afraid of the risk that will happen when they 'short circuit' or have some 'error'. 
											In addition, I worry about the job opportunities for myself and my family and friends, AI could almost perfectly replace manual jobs and a large portion of the service industry. However, AI improves my quality of life, leads to a more comfortable, quality of life. Basically, there's a lot of difference that will emerge as AI evolves to a certain level like AI can help me do all the chores I need, I can focus on my work. 
											That causes the quality of my job becomes higher. However, the needs of the job and the frequency of work will be raised to meet the development of society. I am concerned about whether my health and intelligence are enough to compete with AI. 
											I need to put in more gray matter and work a hundred times more effort than I am now to be able to keep my position, in the face of the powerful development of AI.
