								<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
							</header>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Overview:</b></li>
								<p>I have plans to build a third-person online multiplayer, action-adventure game, and especially it's non-linear. 
									The game will enhance the player's freedom to an absolute extent. The game has no storyline, no main quests, only side quests for you to interact with the NPC (non-player character). 
									The player's choices determine who the player is, a hero, a villain, or a traveler. Players have to write their own story, in the process of their adventure and world exploration. 
									The game takes place in a fantasy world, based on myths and legends in Eastern and Western culture. 
									The game never ends unless the player feels their journey should be over.
								</p>

								<li><b>Motivation:</b></li>
								<p>
									The special feature of this game is the non-linearity, which greatly enhances the player's freedom, making the player no longer bound on the adventure path. 
									Games in the present time have no games that make a clear highlight for the non-linear element, a typical example is the series game Assassin's Creed, the player can kill in any way they want, but all events in the game happen in a certain sequence. 
									Another example is in the detective game series, which has too much linearity, if the player picks up item A, talks to person B, it will trigger the event. 
									If the game is designed well, the player will know what to do, but if the game is designed badly, the player will not know what to do. 
									In my game, the player only needs to do one thing and that is 'to do what they want'.
								</p>

								<li><b>Description:</b></li>
								<p>This is a role-playing game so players can create characters to their liking (character creation system - can be found on other games like Nioh 2, Code Vein, Blade and Soul, etc). 
								</br><p></p>
									For the freedom of the player, the player can choose the starting place in the 4 main-lands. 
									Each land has its own characteristics of terrain and culture, and at the same time, each region also has different mysteries and challenges for players to freely explore (players are required to communicate with NPCs 
									to be able to obtain information about the mystery or challenge). NPC has affection index towards the player, when the affection index reaches a certain level, there will be a change in the attitude of the NPC towards the player (NPC will be more polite or closer to the player); 
									When the level is maxed, the player can marry or ask the NPC to go adventure with him. 
									In addition, there is an indicator of reliability, which will affect the speed and number of increases in the sentiment index. 
									Credibility is based on the reputation the player possessed through his actions and actions prior to meeting the NPC. 
								</br><p></p>
									In addition to these special stats, players also have 3 basic types of stats: 
									Health (HP - Health Point, HP to 0, the player will die), Stamina (SP- Stamina Point, SP to 0, the player falls. In a state of exhaustion and needs to rest) and Energy (MP- Mana Point, MP to 0, the player cannot use the skill). </br>
									On the way to adventure, environmental factors affect the journey a lot, including affecting the player's health. 
									Players are likely to get poisoned, catch a cold, catch a cold, etc; uphold the challenge of survival for players. 
									The mission system will help players integrate more easily with the NPC, and easier to understand the history and culture of the land. 
								</br><p></p>
									The game also gives players real interactive work experiences and in-game life experiences such as marriage, childbirth, and difficulties in the life of an adventurer; Players can also fish, hunt, plant, and build. 
									The game has a system of basic weapons and tools, assisting the player during the game. 
								</br><p></p>
									In order to save players time during the move, the teleport system will help players return to the places they used to go (provided they have activated the checkpoint). 
									The game's magic system emphasizes the player's interaction with the NPC, the player has only two ways to obtain the spell, which is to explore the mystery and from the NPC. 
									Only a few NPCs possess magic, and players need to increase their affection for them, to a certain extent. 
								</br><p></p>
									To ensure game balance, every time a player reaches 10 levels, 'NPC level' = 'player level' + 5. 
									The weapon and tools system will be upgraded at level, as players reach level 50 and level 90. 
									Because the game has no storyline, the game can only end when the player stops the game. 
								</br><p></p>
								</p>

								<li><b>Tools and Technologies:</b></li>
								<p>To build my project, the most basic things I need are Unity game making software and the C # programming language. 
									Unity is a cross-platform game making software developed by Unity Technologies, which is mainly used to develop video games for computers, consoles and phones, 
									in which Unity supports 2D and 3D graphics, functions are written mainly in C #. C # is a powerful, versatile object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft based on C ++ and Java programming languages.
								</p>

								<li><b>Skills Required:</b></li>
								<p>There are many skills needed to be able to do a project, some of which are essential skills that are required. 
									First, I need to know the game, the genre of the game, about the game's operation structure. 
									Second, it is necessary to have a little knowledge of Mathematics and Physics to help programming thinking better, can describe the character's movements more accurately and "smoother". 
									Third, it is necessary to have knowledge of design and graphics to design a more realistic, beautiful context, and especially, the graphic affects a lot of the coding process. 
									Finally, I have to master the C # programming language to use Unity. 
									I can find this information and study materials in the school library or on the internet.
								</p>

								<li><b>Outcome:</b></li>
								<p>If my project is successful, then this project could become proof to emphasize the non-linear element and take a new wind away into the game world (absolute non-linear game). 
									Game makers can change their way of making games (focus more on non-linear elements) to make it enhance player freedom more, make the game interesting, not fall into the deadlock.
